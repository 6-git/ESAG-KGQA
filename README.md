# ESAG-KGQA
This repository contains the open-source implementation of the "ESAG-KGQA" model proposed in the paper "ESAG-KGQA: An Entity Shuffling-Augmented Generation Framework for Knowledge Graph Question Answering with Fine-Tuned Large Language Models" (accepted by ECAI 2025).


We are currently preparing to open-source the code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.
